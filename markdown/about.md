# Task in Research 🔍

In our research, we use **TT-graphs** to explore the influence of textual and graphic narrative structures on the understanding and interpretation of news stories. **TT-graphs** serve as a valuable tool for visually communicating narratives and facilitating comparative studies of **textual** and **graphic** structures.
