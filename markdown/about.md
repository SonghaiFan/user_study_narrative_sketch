# About the Task in Research üîç

In our research, we use **TT-graphs** to explore the influence of textual and graphic narrative structures on the understanding and interpretation of news stories. **TT-graphs** serve as a valuable tool for visually communicating narratives and facilitating comparative studies of **textual** and **graphic** structures.

Your task involves:

## Training

> **Reading the news chapters** on the right.

> **Selecting the narrative structure** that best aligns with the corresponding **TT-graph** on the left.

During the training, after you've selected a narrative structure, you'll see a detailed text that includes a title, key words (`theme` and `entity`), and a brief explanation. This part of the study is to help you understand the **TT-graphs** and learn how to sketch the narrative structures.

## Task

In the actual task phase, there will be no hints provided. Instead, you will:

> **Select the narrative structure** based solely on your interpretation of the text.

> **Write down your reasoning and rate your confidence level** for each selection.

## Before you start

| ‚è±Ô∏è Please be aware of the time. You've only paid for 30 minutes. Ensure to maintain a balanced pace - not too slow or too fast. Remember, if you take too long, you won't be compensated for the extra time. On the other hand, rushing through and underperforming may negatively impact your pay. |

| There are 10 tasks for a total of 9 motifs, which means there's a chance that one motif can appear more than once. |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| We encourage you to make the "right" choices. "Right" in this context means not exactly the same as our predefined narrative structures. As long as you understand how the TT graphs work and provide sound reasoning, that's considered the right choice. Good luck! üåü |
