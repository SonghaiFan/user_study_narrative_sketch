## **Introduction:**

In today's digital era, we're flooded with news from every corner of the world. The structure and understanding of these stories can greatly vary based on their **narrative**. Our study is here to decode this.

The study has two primary phases:

1. **Narrative Selection**:

   - Dive deep into news stories we provide.
   - Match them with narrative structures from our list.
   - **Note**: You can select up to _three_ structures that resonate the most with each story.

**To-Do**:

- [ ] Read the story
- [ ] Match with narrative structure
- [ ] Choose best three

If you're new to narrative structures or mapping, no worries! Our platform will guide you. Remember, there's no **right** or **wrong** here. We cherish genuine reactions and insights.
