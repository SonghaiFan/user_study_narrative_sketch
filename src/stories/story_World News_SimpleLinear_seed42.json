The central figures in this debate were Sarah Thomson, an emerging politician advocating for universal healthcare, and Demetrio Vasquez, a controversial leader known for his populist policies. Thomson argued that the current electoral system was skewed in favor of the wealthy and powerful, and proposed reforms to level the playing field. Vasquez, on the other hand, claimed that the proposed changes were an attempt to undermine the will of the people. The debate raged on, with both sides garnering significant support. As of November 2021, the fate of these electoral reforms remains uncertain."
