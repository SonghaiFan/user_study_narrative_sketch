# **Welcome to Our User Study on Sketching Narrative Structures!**

# Consent Form
## Invitation to Participate in the Study
You are invited to participate in a study titled "Sketching Narrative Structures". This study is being conducted by the Department of Human Centred Computing, Monash University. 
Please read through this explanatory statement before deciding whether to participate. If you require further information regarding any aspect of this project, you are encouraged to contact the researchers via the email addresses provided.
## Project Details
**Project ID:** 36056

**Project Title:** Sketching Narrative Structures

**Student Investigator:** 
   - Songhai Fan (songhai.fan@monash.edu)


**Co-Investigators:** 
   - Dr. Ying Yang (ying.yang@monash.edu), 
   - Professor Tim Dwyer (tim.dwyer@monash.edu),
   - Professor Helen Purchase (helen.purchase@monash.edu)
   - Simon Angus (simon.angus@monash.edu)

## What Does the Research Involve?
This study aims to investigate the influence of textual and graphic narrative structures on the understanding and interpretation of news stories. We will use datasets generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) with predefined narrative structures to explore the effectiveness and comprehension of news structures.
If you choose to participate, you will be asked to:

   - [ ] Provide a Prolific ID
   - [ ] Participate in a user study involving visualisations and narrative structures
   - [ ] Finish task and answer questions based on the text or visualisation
   - [ ] Complete a survey

Your participation is entirely voluntary and you may choose to withdraw at any stage without any implications.
## Why Were You Chosen for this Research?
You have been invited to participate in this research because your experience and opinions are valuable to our study. 


## Confidentiality and Data Storage
The confidentiality of your data is a priority. Any personally identifiable information will not be shared with anyone not involved in this project. All data collected will be stored securely and will be retained for five years after the completion of the study.

## Payment
As a token of gratitude, we offer a payment of ‚Ç¨15 per hour upon completion of the study. The payment will be processed manually and transferred to your Prolific.co account.

## Complaints

Should you have any concerns or complaints about the conduct of the project, you are welcome to contact the Executive Officer, Monash University Human Research Ethics (MUHREC) at muhrec@monash.edu or +61 3 9905 2052.

# TT-Graphs: An Introduction
In our study, we introduce the concept of TT-graphs, or Theme-Time graphs, as a method of visually representing narrative structures. 
## Definition
A TT-graph is a directed graph constructed on a narrative space grid defined by a matrix of dimensions. Each node (vertex) in the TT-graph corresponds to an element in the matrix, and nodes are labeled based on their position. The label of the node at the intersection of the -th row (representing a theme) and the -th column (representing time) is given by:

Node_Label = Theme{row_index}Time{column_index}

## Characteristics
- **Directed Edges**: Edges in TT-graphs are directed and can only be formed from left to right.
- **Row-Equivalence**: Two TT-graphs are considered identical if one can be obtained from the other by a series of row swaps.
- **No Isolated Timeframes**: If a column (representing a timeframe) is empty, then all columns to its right should also be empty.
## Narrative Motifs in TT-Graphs
Given the restrictions and structure of the TT-graph, the minimal motifs that can be observed are:
1. **SingleThemeEvolution(retain)**: This motif consists of a series of directed edges representing the evolution or continuation of a single theme through time.
2. **SingleStepForward(shift)**: This motif represents a shift from one theme to another over a single time step.
## Use in Research
In our research, we use TT-graphs to explore the influence of textual and graphic narrative structures on the understanding and interpretation of news stories. TT-graphs serve as a valuable tool for visually communicating narratives and facilitating comparative studies of textual and graphic
