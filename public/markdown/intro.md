# Introduction to Our Study on Narrative Perception in the Digital Age üåêüìö

In this digital era, we're constantly bombarded with information. It's tempting to bypass lengthy texts, leading to the familiar "TL;DR" scenario. Here, language models step in as digital assistants, adept at distilling complex texts. But, summarizing news stories is not just about brevity; it's about retaining the story's essence. We're exploring how people understand these condensed narratives. Do visual aids like graphs enhance comprehension? We're combining human insight with technological efficiency to better understand text narratives.

# Understanding TT-Graphs

In our study, we introduce the concept of **Theme-Time graphs (TT-graphs)**, as a method of visually representing narrative structures. Imagine a grid like a chessboard or a spreadsheet. In a TT-Graph, nodes representing story chapters are plotted on a grid. The position of a node on the grid is determined by two coordinates: the `x-coordinate` and the `y-coordinate`.

The `x-coordinate` (horizontal axis) represents time üìÖ. It's like a timeline that shows when things happen in the story. As you move from left to right along the x-axis, you're moving forward in time ‚û°Ô∏è. Thus, each column represents a distinct timeframe.

The `y-coordinate` (vertical axis) represents different themes or topics in the story üìö. Each row on the y-axis corresponds to a different theme. So, if a node is in the third row, for example, that means it's part of the third theme.

This figure shows how different themes have developed over a period. It is split into two parts:

### Upper Part: Single Theme Trend

The top graph focuses on one theme, "Global Alliances." Each block represents a period when this theme was prominent. The timeline runs from June 2020 to October 2023. The yellow blocks are spaced evenly across the timeline, suggesting that the theme of Global Alliances has been consistent over time.

### Lower Part: Multiple Themes and Connections

The bottom graph displays three themes: "Populism Rise," "Global Alliances," and "Electoral Reforms," each marked with a different color. This part of the figure shows not only when these themes were relevant (along the timeline at the bottom) but also how they are connected.

The connections between these blocks (shown as lines) suggest a relationship or a sequence of events where one theme leads to another over time.

## Characteristics

**One-way Paths**: The lines in TT-graphs can only go from left to right, like reading a book üìñ.

**Row Swapping**: Two TT-graphs are considered the same if you can get from one to the other by just swapping rows around .

**No Empty Timeframes Gap**: Columns (which represent certain timeframes) cannot have an empty column between them. For instance, if we think of the columns as "Past", "Present", and "Future", we can't have nodes in "Past" and "Future" without anything in the "Present" .
