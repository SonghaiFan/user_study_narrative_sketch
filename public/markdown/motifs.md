# Narrative Motifs in TT-Graphs

Narrative motifs in TT (Theme-Time) layout graphs are recurring patterns or structures that help to depict how themes evolve over time in a narrative. They are like the building blocks of a story, representing the simplest units of meaning within the narrative structure.

| Motif           | Description                                                                                                                                                           | Themes | Timeframes | Image                                                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linear**      | The narrative unfolds over three timeframes, all following a single theme in a sequential order.                                                                      | 1      | 3          | ![Linear](/user_study_narrative_sketch/images/motifs/Linear.png)           |
| **Arch**        | The narrative spans three timeframes, starting with one theme, shifting to another in the second timeframe, then returning to the first theme in the third timeframe. | 2      | 3          | ![Arch](/user_study_narrative_sketch/images/motifs/Arch.png)               |
| **Ladder**      | The narrative progresses over three timeframes, each timeframe introducing a new theme, leading to a total of three themes.                                           | 3      | 3          | ![Ladder](/user_study_narrative_sketch/images/motifs/Ladder.png)           |
| **LongFork**    | Over three timeframes, the narrative follows one theme for the first two timeframes, then shifts to a second theme for the final timeframe.                           | 2      | 3          | ![LongFork](/user_study_narrative_sketch/images/motifs/LongFork.png)       |
| **ShortFork**   | The narrative starts with one theme in the first timeframe, then shifts to a second theme for the remaining two timeframes.                                           | 2      | 3          | ![ShortFork](/user_study_narrative_sketch/images/motifs/ShortFork.png)     |
| **WideMerge**   | Over two timeframes, two different themes in the same timeframe converge into a shared theme in the last timeframe.                                                   | 3      | 2          | ![WideMerge](/user_study_narrative_sketch/images/motifs/WideMerge.png)     |
| **WideBranch**  | The narrative starts with one theme in the first timeframe and branches out to two different themes in the following timeframe.                                       | 3      | 2          | ![WideBranch](/user_study_narrative_sketch/images/motifs/WideBranch.png)   |
| **SharpMerge**  | Over two timeframes, two different themes in the same timeframe then converge into one of the previous themes in the last timeframe.                                  | 2      | 2          | ![SharpMerge](/user_study_narrative_sketch/images/motifs/SharpMerge.png)   |
| **SharpBranch** | The narrative starts with one theme in the first timeframe and diverges to a new theme while retaining the original theme in the following timeframe.                 | 2      | 2          | ![SharpBranch](/user_study_narrative_sketch/images/motifs/SharpBranch.png) |
